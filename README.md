# Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply computer vision through CNN to identify the different species of butterflies, we will be using transfer learning with ResNet50 and we will be opening and closing the layers of the pre-trained CNN to see when we have the best performance

# Methods Used
We will be using Computer Vision through CNN, we will build a CNN from scratch, and then use transfer learning through ResNet50

# Technologies
Python
ResNet50

# Project Description
This exercise was inspired by: https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/10_Fine-Tuning.ipynb

The dataset that we work on contains around 28k images of six butterfly species, it was created by ETHâ€™s research collection (v0.2) https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/365379

In this project we will be using a CNN from scratch as baseline and then use ResNet50 transfer learning (escalating the number of trainable layers) to see what technique offers the best performance
